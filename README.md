#### _User can order multiple Pizzas, 2016-1-27_

#### By _**Nic Netzel, with gracious thanks to awesome pair partners earlier in the week**_

## Description

_User can select a number of different options and order multiple pizzas. It has a tip calculator tht is dependent on the delivery method to suggest the tip._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _run it as a website here_ [http://netzeln.github.io/pizzasite/]
*_or clone it and look at it on your own_



## Known Bugs


_The tip calculator math uses a mix of toFloat and toFixed, so it tends to be off by a penny in favor of the seller, but we'll call that a feature, not a bug_



## Technologies Used

_Html, CSS, jQuery, javascript_
