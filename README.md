# _{Pizza Site Code Review}_

#### _{User can order multiple Pizzas}, {2016-1-27}_

#### By _**{Nic Netzel, with gracious thanks to awesome pair partners earlier in the week**_

## Description

_{User can select a number of different options and order multiple pizzas. It has a tip calculator tht is dependent on the delivery method to suggest the tip. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _run it as a website here_
*_or clone it and look at it on your own_



## Known Bugs

_The Spec Tests are still failing, because I don't know the syntax to write the fake input information when it is within multiple arrays and objects and prototypes that need to talk to each other.

Also, the tip calculator math uses a mix of toFloat and toFixed, so it tends to be off by a penny in favor of the seller, but we'll call that a feature, not a bug

given more time there are other features I'd like to try to implement, including making it prettier_
